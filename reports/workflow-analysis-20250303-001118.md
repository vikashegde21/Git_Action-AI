## 📊 Implementation Details

### Current Implementation
```yaml
name: Create and Test Python Application
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.x
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip

        pip install -r requirements.txt

        '
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
'on':
  push:
    branches:
    - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
    - main

```

### Recommended Improvements
- 🔍 Add code linting (e.g., flake8, pylint) for code quality
- 📊 Implement test coverage reporting
- 🏷️ Add type checking for better code reliability
- 💾 Implement dependency caching to reduce build times

## 📈 Performance Metrics
